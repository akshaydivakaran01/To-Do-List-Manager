**📱 To-Do List Manager Web Application built using React JS**

📝 Description:
      Developed a dynamic, responsive and interactive To-Do List Manager using React, enabling users to efficiently manage their tasks with features to add, delete, and update tasks using a clean and intuitive user interface.
        Key Features:
          🔸Task Management: Users can add new tasks, delete and update existing tasks.
          🔸State Management: Utilized React's useState hook for managing the state of tasks and input fields.
          🔸Event Handling: Implemented event handlers for user interactions such as adding, deleting, and updating tasks in the To-Do list.
          🔸Conditional Rendering: Validated and rendered tasks dynamically based on input, ensuring tasks are only added when the input is not empty, maintaining a clean and error-free user experience.
          🔸Responsive Design: Utilized Bootstrap framework in conjunction with custom CSS media queries to ensure optimal layout and functionality across a wide range of devices—from large desktop monitors and                                     laptops to tablets and mobile phones.
          🔸Alert Notifications: Integrated Toastify library for user-friendly alert notifications during task operations, enhancing usability.

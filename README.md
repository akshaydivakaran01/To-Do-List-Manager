# :iphone: To-Do List Manager Web Application

<!-- Description Section -->
## :books: Description
Developed a dynamic, responsive and interactive To-Do List Manager using React, enabling users to efficiently manage their tasks with features to add, delete, and update tasks using a clean and intuitive user interface. This project is purely front-end, utilizing JavaScript and React JS without any backend. The application leverages local storage to save tasks, ensuring data persistence even after restarting the app or refreshing the browser. All data management is handled within the browser, making the app lightweight and easy to deploy.

### :name_badge: Key Features
-  **Task Management**: Users can add new tasks, delete and update existing tasks.
- **State Management**: Utilized React's useState hook for managing the state of tasks and input fields.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event handlers for user interactions such as adding, deleting, and updating tasks in the To-Do list.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Validated and rendered tasks dynamically based on input, ensuring tasks are only added when the input is not empty, maintaining a clean and error-free user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilized Bootstrap framework in conjunction with custom CSS media queries to ensure optimal layout and functionality across a wide range of devicesâ€”from large desktop monitors and laptops to tablets and mobile phones.
- **Alert Notifications**: Integrated Toastify library for user-friendly alert notifications during task operations, enhancing usability.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Leveraged the browser's local storage capabilities using JavaScript functions. This allows the application to store tasks persistently, so users do not lose their data even after restarting the app or refreshing the browser.
